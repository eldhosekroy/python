Algorithm for HMM POS Tagging

Step 1: Import nltk, treebank, and hmm, then download the required datasets.

Step 2: Load first 3000 sentences as training data and next 100 as testing data from the Treebank corpus.

Step 3: Initialize the Hidden Markov Model Trainer.

Step 4: Train the HMM POS tagger using the training dataset.

Step 5: Tokenize a sample sentence and use the trained tagger to predict POS tags.

Step 6: Print the POS-tagged words.
