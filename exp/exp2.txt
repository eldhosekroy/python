Algorithm for Generating Concordance Using NLTK

Step 1: Import the nltk library.

Step 2: Open and read the contents of the text file (mydata.txt).

Step 3: Tokenize the text into words using nltk.word_tokenize().

Step 4: Create an nltk.Text object using the tokenized words.

Step 5: Generate and display a concordance for a specific word (e.g., "network") with a specified width and number of lines.
